# go-cv

go-cv is a computer vision and image processing library for Go using Golang assembly. It is a works-in-progress wrapper around the [Simd](https://github.com/ermig1979/Simd) library. For now most work has been done on the SSE2 version.

## SIMD
The [Simd](https://github.com/ermig1979/Simd) Library is a highly optimized image processing library. It provides many useful high performance algorithms for image processing such as:
- pixel format conversion
- image scaling and filtration
- extraction of statistic information from images
- motion detection
- object detection (HAAR and LBP classifier cascades)
- classification
- neural network

The algorithms are optimized using different SIMD CPU extensions. In particular the library supports following CPU extensions:
- x86/x64: SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX and AVX2
- ARM: NEON

## Installation

```
$ go get -u "github.com/fwessels/go-cv"
```

## Samples

See the `samples` directory for various sample algorithms. For example:

```
$ cd samples
$ go run filtering.go
```

## Performance compared to OpenCV 2.x

A comparison against [go-opencv](https://github.com/lazywei/go-opencv) shows the following results:
